      <!--  Note that for min-width of 768px at 80% of the viewport, the device's screen width would need to reach 1001px before the browser switches to the 1000px wide version of banner.jpg.  This is because it uses a ratio of the width descriptor value divided by the actual screen width * viewport width percentage.  eg screen width of 1001px * .8 (80vw) = 800.8.  Then the ratio of 800w (width descriptor) / 800.8 < 1 so the browser will step up from banner_800.jpg to use banner.jpg (which is 1000px wide) so its ratio value is > 1 again... 

      Also, note that even in Firefox's Responsive Design Mode, you will need to manually alter the width values to see this work as it would on an actual physical device.  The device built-in values don't seem to update the browser correctly.  :-( -->

        <h2>The Iron Brigade of the West</h2>
        <p>The Iron Brigade was the only brigade in the Union's Army of the Potomac whose regiments were all from the West. They would quickly become one of the elite shock units in the Union army. The Iron Brigade was usually in the thick of the fight at places like South Mountain (where a relative of Mr Cooley's, George W. Cooley of the 7th Wisconsin, was killed in action), in the cornfield at Antietam, and of course at Gettysburg as seen with the 2nd Wisconsin in the painting above.</p><br>

        <p>Unfortunately, this type of action almost always resulted in heavy casualties, and Gettysburg was no exception to this. The brigade came into the battle nearly 1,900 men strong and suffered more than 1,100 casualties.  The 2nd Wisconsin would lead the sad list with a loss of 77%.</p>
